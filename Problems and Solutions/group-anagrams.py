# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:
# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            arr = [ c for c in s]
            arr.sort()
            d[('').join(arr)].append(s)
        return d.values()
